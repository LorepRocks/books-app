        'Novela de la inglesa Jane Austen (1775–1817) publicada en 1817 y pionera en su género. En ella se combina con gran maestría la pincelada realista y costumbrista y la sátira poética y sentimental de la Inglaterra de principios del siglo XIX.

      description:
        'At the age of 19, Ian Waterman was suddenly struck down at work by a rare neurological illness that deprived him of all sensation below the neck. He fell on the floor in a heap, unable to stand or control his limbs, having lost the sense of joint position and proprioception, of that "sixth sense" of his body in space, which we all take for granted. After months in a neurological ward he was judged incurable and condemned to a life of wheelchair dependence. This is the first U.S. publication of a remarkable book by his physician, Jonathan Cole. It tells the compelling story, including a clear clinical description of a rare condition, of how Waterman reclaimed a life of full mobility against all expectations, by mental effort and sheer courage. Cole describes how Waterman gradually adapted to his strange condition. As the doctors had predicted, there was no neurological recovery. He had to monitor every movement by sight to work out where his limbs were, since he had no feedback from his peripheral nerves. But with astonishing persistence Waterman developed elaborate tricks and strategies to control his movements, enabling him to cope not only with the day-to-day problems of living, but even with the challenges of work, love, and marriage.',

        'Jams Austen (1775-1817)Jane Austen Has Been Regarded By Critics As The Moot Perfect Artist In English Fiction. George Saintsbury Compared Her To Shakespeare Whose Detachment And Elusiveness She Certainly Shares. She Was A Truly Great Novelist Of Manners Among The Country Gentry. Born In The Family Of A Rector Of Steventon In Hampshire, Jane Austen Had Her Early Education In Oxford And Reading. She Started Writing Early In Life. Between 1792 And 1798 She Completed Her First Four Novels, Lady Susan, First Impressions (Later Entitled Pride And Prejudice), Elinor And Marianne (Later Called Sense And Sensibility) And Northanger Abbey. Later She Produced Three More Novels: Mansfield Park, Emma And Persuasion. She Contracted Tuberculosis And Died Tragically Early At The Age Of 41. Although Not Recognized In Her Time, Her Popularity Has Increased, Rather Than Faded, With The Passing Of Years, Which Will Be Evident From The Remark Of F.R. Leavis: Jane Austen Inaugurated The Great Tradition Of Fiction. Pride And Prejudice Was Jane Austen S First Novel. She Started Writing It In 1797 Under The Title First Impressions. Later She Revised It And It Was Published In 1813 Under The Title Pride And Prejudice. It Is A Novel Mainly Concerned With The Problems Of Marriage. Four Pairs, Elizabeth And Darcy, Jane And Bingley, Charlotte And Collins, Lydia And Wickham Are Married On Different Considerations. The Main 3Tory Concerns The First Pair Who Are First Separated Because Of Their Pride And Prejudice And Later Reconciled And United As Their Misunderstandings Are Removed. This Novel Has Been Accepted As The Masterpiece Of The Novelist Having A Superbly Balanced Plot-Construction And A Well-Defined Character Development. Jane Austen Here Succeeded In Wedding Realism To A Lively Dialogue And Evolved A Witty Narrative Style To Express In The Most Vital Manner The Story Of A Young Girl And Her Love.',

Collects the original digital series The Pride and The Pride Adventures in print for the first time. "[F]or readers hungry for queer superheroes. Joe Glass\' The Pride introduces a superhero universe built on LGBTQ+ inclusion, following a team that is explicitly created to show the range of the queer experience. The Pride features superheroes who are gay, lesbian, bi, trans, non-binary, and children of gay parents. Glass blends modern queer issues with classic superhero storytelling to tell narratives that classic superhero comics haven\'t touched. . . . The Pride excels at using queer struggle and joy to show a different side of the superhero genre."--AV Club "I highly recommend this smart, charming, wonderful book to anyone who likes good comics. It\'s absolutely a pleasure to read and a clear labor of love."--Gail Simone, Batgirl, Leaving Megalopolis, Clean Room "Old-school and progressive at the same time. Classic, high-energy superhero action that gives the queer community the heroes they\'ve always deserved."--Steve Orlando, Midnighter, Virgil "The Pride is the modern, inclusive, and compelling superhero epic the world needs today."--Alex Segura, co-writer of The Black Ghost and author of the acclaimed Pete Fernandez Miami Mystery novel series.',

      title: 'Pride Against Prejudice',
      subtitle: 'The Biography of Larry Doby',
      authors: ['Joseph Thomas Moore'],
      publisher: 'Praeger',
      publishedDate: '1988',
      description:
        "Aware of Mr. Doby's neglect by biographers, Mr. Moore, who has been a fan of his subject ever since he heard the Doby legend, seeks to give him recognition. . . . Mr. Moore effectively uses records, interviews, and a clear narrative style to make his points (what is more persuasive in sports than an athlete's record! what is more animated than public statements and their refutations!), and gives voice to some of Mr. Doby's severest critics.... Pride Against Prejudice is a tribute to both its author and Larry Doby New York Times Book Review This is an excellent biography of Larry Doby, the first black player in the American League and one of the first black managers in the major leagues. . . . Moore has done a superb job of researching Doby's life and writing about it. The book is highly recommended. The Sporting News As the second black major league baseball player, following Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby has never received the acclaim accorded to Robinson; yet his experiences of segregation and racial invective, and his courage and ability to excel in the face of almost overwhelming circumstances, were equivalent. This fascinating biography brings to light many interesting and little-known facts concerning Doby's life and baseball career, and his contribution as a civil rights pioneer in the American League. His story is perceived as the story of the many black men who followed him into major league baseball, and who shared importantly in pioneering the integration of the sport.",
